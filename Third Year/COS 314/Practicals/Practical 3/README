# Program Name
Mushroom Classification using Backpropagation Neural Network and Genetic Programming

## Description
Mushroom train data is given to both the Neural network and the Genetic Program separately. Both algorithms should then be able to correctly classify the mushrooms in the test data into class 1 or 0.

## Usage
Make sure you are using wsl2.
option 1:
```bash
make clean
make
make run
```

option 2:
```bash
make all
```


## Expected Output
Neural Netowrk
Testing the neural network
Accuracy: 58.8723%
Specificity: 0
Sensitivity: 1
F-measure: 0.741127


Genetic Program
Accuracy: 58.8723%
Specificity: 0
Sensitivity: 1
F-measure: 0.588723
