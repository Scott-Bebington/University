## Description

This project demonstrates how to calculate the next and previous values of the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. In this project, we provide a method to calculate the next and previous values of the Fibonacci sequence based on a given number.

### Usage

To get the next value of the Fibonacci sequence, use the following code:

## Files

- `home.cgi`: This file reads the 3 numbers of the fibonacci sequence and outputs them to the screen.
- `next.cgi`: This file gets the next value in the sequence and writes the 3 values to the numbers.txt file, it then redirects the user back to the home page.
- `prev.cgi`: This file gets the previous value in the sequence and writes the 3 values to the numbers.txt file, it then redirects the user back to the home page.
- `reset.cgi`: This file resets the text file va;lues to the first 3 in the sequence, it then redirects the user back to the home page.
- `numbers.txt`: A text file contyaining 3 values of the fibonacci sequence and the iteration number.

## Usage

1. To zip the files, run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    sudo tar -cvzPf u21546216.tar /usr/lib/cgi-bin
    ```

    This will create a `u21546216.tar` file containing all the specified files.
    make sure to be in the cgi-bin directory before running the command.

2. To unzip the files, run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    sudo tar -xvzPf u21546216.tar
    ```

    This will extract all the files from the `u21546216.zip` archive.
    make sure to be in the directory containing the `u21546216.tar` file before running the command.
