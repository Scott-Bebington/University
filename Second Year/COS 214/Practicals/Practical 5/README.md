 ## Alcoholics with a coding problem

# Coding Standards
 ## Naming Convention
  - Camel Case
  ### Variables
   - Internal read-only variables: start with '_'
   - Names should be self-explanatory
 
 ## Headers use '#pragma once' instead of '#ifndef...#define'
  ### Reason: faster, less obtuse

 ## Comments
  - Make comments in header files to explain functions (not too long comments)
 ## Brackets on same line with function and class declarations

 - Use smartptr and uniqueptr where applicable (to be implemented)
 - class names start with capital
 - use structs with classes that have no descendants or functions. Only public variables.
